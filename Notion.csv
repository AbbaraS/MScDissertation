Registration of multi-modal medical images has important implications for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-guided surgery as it provides the means of bringing together complimentary information obtained from different image modalities. However, since different image modalities have different properties due to their different acquisition methods, it remains a challenging task to find a fast and accurate match between multi-modal images. Furthermore, due to reasons such as ethical issues and need for human expert intervention, it is difficult to collect a large database of labelled multi-modal medical images. In addition, manual input is required to determine the fixed and moving images as input to registration algorithms. In this paper, we address these issues and introduce a registration framework that (1) creates synthetic data to augment existing datasets, (2) generates ground truth data to be used in the training and testing of algorithms, (3) registers (using a combination of deep learning and conventional machine learning methods) multi-modal images in an accurate and fast manner, and (4) automatically classifies the image modality so that the process of registration can be fully automated. We validate the performance of the proposed framework on CT and MRI images of the head obtained from a publicly available registration database.",,,,2,,1860,,A deep learning based framework for the registration of three dimensional multi-modal medical images of the head,,A

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.",,,,3,,,,A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions,,A

The precise pathophysiological mechanism of TTS is still unknown, but recent evidence suggests a central role of systemic inflammation associated with adrenergic discharge. Although initially considered benign, TTS has shown several potential short-term and long-term complications and adverse outcomes. To improve understanding and management, advanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques, such as feature tracking (FT) and parametric mapping, have gained attention. Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the clinical applications of CMR-FT and mapping in TTS. Additionally, the most significant and recent findings will be discussed. Recent Findings: FT-CMR enables the parametric quantification of myocardial deformation, allowing a comprehensive evaluation of left ventricular, right ventricular, and atrial function. It provides an accurate definition of areas of myocardial dysfunction and potentially serves as a superior prognostic tool compared to ejection fraction. Tissue mapping techniques enable precise and comprehensive tissue characterization by quantifying areas of oedema, and myocardial fibrosis. Summary: FT-CMR and mapping techniques serve as valuable prognostic tools both in the acute and chronic phases of TTS. They can detect subtle alterations and pan-cardiac involvement, while also providing important insights into the complex underlying mechanisms of the syndrome.",6,61-71,,4,,,,Advanced Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Takotsubo Syndrome: Update on Feature Tracking and Tissue Mapping,,A

However, the utility of machine learning in distinguishing between takotsubo syndrome (TTS) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been studied. Objectives: To assess the utility of machine learning systems for automatic discrimination of TTS and AMI. Design, Settings, and Participants: This cohort study included clinical data and transthoracic echocardiogram results of patients with AMI from the Zurich Acute Coronary Syndrome Registry and patients with TTS obtained from 7 cardiovascular centers in the International Takotsubo Registry. Data from the validation cohort were obtained from April 2011 to February 2017. Data from the training cohort were obtained from March 2017 to May 2019. Data were analyzed from September 2019 to June 2021. Exposure: Transthoracic echocardiograms of 224 patients with TTS and 224 patients with AMI were analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the machine learning system evaluated on an independent data set and 4 practicing cardiologists for comparison. Echocardiography videos of 228 patients were used in the development and training of a deep learning model. The performance of the automated echocardiogram video analysis method was evaluated on an independent data set consisting of 220 patients. Data were matched according to age, sex, and ST-segment elevation/non-ST-segment elevation (1 patient with AMI for each patient with TTS). Predictions were compared with echocardiographic-based interpretations from 4 practicing cardiologists in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and AUC calculated from confidence scores concerning their binary diagnosis. Results: In this cohort study, apical 2-chamber and 4-chamber echocardiographic views of 110 patients with TTS (mean [SD] age, 68.4 [12.1] years; 103 [90.4%] were female) and 110 patients with AMI (mean [SD] age, 69.1 [12.2] years; 103 [90.4%] were female) from an independent data set were evaluated. This approach achieved a mean (SD) AUC of 0.79 (0.01) with an overall accuracy of 74.8 (0.7%). In comparison, cardiologists achieved a mean (SD) AUC of 0.71 (0.03) and accuracy of 64.4 (3.5%) on the same data set. In a subanalysis based on 61 patients with apical TTS and 56 patients with AMI due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the model achieved a mean (SD) AUC score of 0.84 (0.01) and an accuracy of 78.6 (1.6%), outperforming the 4 practicing cardiologists (mean [SD] AUC, 0.72 [0.02]) and accuracy of 66.9 (2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, a real-time system for fully automated interpretation of echocardiogram videos was established and trained to differentiate TTS from AMI. While this system was more accurate than cardiologists in echocardiography-based disease classification, further studies are warranted for clinical application.",5,494-503,35353118,8,,,,Assessment of Artificial Intelligence in Echocardiography Diagnostics in Differentiating Takotsubo Syndrome from Myocardial Infarction,,A

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 3 groups of patients: TS (n=18), AM (n=14), and 11 healthy subjects. All the patients had complete CMR data for features tracking assessment. Differences in reservoir, conduit strain (ϵe), conduit strain rate (SRe), and booster phase of biatrial strain were analyzed between the groups using analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of covariance analyses. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility was assessed for all strain and SR parameters using intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Atrial strain was feasible in all patients and controls.

Since atrial involvement may have a significant role, we assessed the diagnostic and prognostic potential of atrial cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) in TTS. Methods and results: This multicentre study recruited 152 TTS patients who underwent CMR on average within 3 days after hospitalization. Reservoir [total strain ϵs and peak positive strain rate (SR) SRs], conduit (passive strain ϵe and peak early negative SRe), and booster pump function (active strain ϵa and peak late negative SRa) were assessed in a core laboratory. Results were compared with 21 control patients with normal biventricular function. A total of 20 patients underwent follow-up CMR (median 3.5 months, interquartile range 3-5). All patients were approached for general follow-up. Left atrial (LA) but not right atrial (RA) reservoir and conduit function were impaired during the acute phase (ϵs: P = 0.043, ϵe: P < 0.001, SRe: P = 0.047 vs. controls) and recovered until follow-up (ϵs: P < 0.001, SRs: P = 0.04, ϵe: P = 0.001, SRe: P = 0.04). LA and RA booster pump function were increased in the acute setting (LA-ϵa: P = 0.045, SRa: P = 0.002 and RA-ϵa: P = 0.004, SRa: P = 0.002 vs. controls).

Among noninvasive imaging techniques, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming increasingly important in evaluating patients with TS. CMR offers a unique ability to noninvasively assess myocardial tissue characteristics, allowing for detecting the typical features of TS, such as specific wall motion abnormalities and myocardial edema.

Methods: This retrospective study evaluated CMR scans of 107 consecutive patients (49 ICM, 58 NICM), including atrial and ventricular strain parameters. We used these data to compare an explainable tree-based gradient boosting additive model with four traditional ML models for the differentiation of ICM and NICM. The models were trained and internally validated with repeated cross-validation according to discrimination and calibration. Furthermore, we examined important variables for distinguishing between ICM and NICM. Results: A total of 107 patients and 38 variables were available for the analysis. Of those, 49 were ICM (34 males, mean age 60 ± 9 years) and 58 patients were NICM (38 males, mean age 56 ± 19 years). After 10 repetitions of the tenfold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved the highest area under curve (0.82, 95% CI [0.47–1.00]) and lowest Brier score (0.19, 95% CI [0.13–0.27]), showing competitive diagnostic accuracy and calibration. At the Youden’s index, sensitivity was 0.72 (95% CI [0.68–0.76]), the highest of all. Analysis of predictions revealed that both atrial and ventricular strain CMR parameters were important for the identification of ICM patients. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that using a ML model, multi chamber myocardial strain, and function on non-contrast CMR parameters enables the discrimination between ICM and NICM with competitive diagnostic accuracy. Clinical relevance statement: A machine learning model based on non-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters may discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy enabling wider access to cardiovascular magnetic resonance examinations with lower costs and faster imaging acquisition. Key Points: • The exponential growth in cardiovascular magnetic resonance examinations may require faster and more cost-effective protocols. • Artificial intelligence models can be utilized to distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies. • Machine learning using non-contrast CMR parameters can effectively distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.

Menon,Shobhit Madan","Background: Pediatric cardiomyopathies are a rare, yet heterogeneous group of pathologies of the myocardium that are routinely examined clinically using Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). This gold standard powerful non-invasive tool yields high resolution temporal images that characterize myocardial tissue. The complexities associated with the annotation of images and extraction of markers, necessitate the development of efficient workflows to acquire, manage and transform this data into actionable knowledge for patient care to reduce mortality and morbidity. Methods: We develop and test a novel informatics framework called cMRI-BED for biomarker extraction and discovery from such complex pediatric cMRI data that includes the use of a suite of tools for image processing, marker extraction and predictive modeling. We applied our workflow to obtain and analyze a dataset of 83 de-identified cases and controls containing cMRI-derived biomarkers for classifying positive versus negative findings of cardiomyopathy in children. Bayesian rule learning (BRL) methods were applied to derive understandable models in the form of propositional rules with posterior probabilities pertaining to their validity. Popular machine learning methods in the WEKA data mining toolkit were applied using default parameters to assess cross-validation performance of this dataset using accuracy and percentage area under ROC curve (AUC) measures. Results: The best 10-fold cross validation predictive performance obtained on this cMRI-derived biomarker dataset was 80.72% accuracy and 79.6% AUC by a BRL decision tree model, which is promising from this type of rare data. Moreover, we were able to verify that mycocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) status, which is known to be an important qualitative factor in the classification of cardiomyopathies, is picked up by our rule models as an important variable for prediction. Conclusions: Preliminary results show the feasibility of our framework for processing such data while also yielding actionable predictive classification rules that can augment knowledge conveyed in cardiac radiology outcome reports. Interactions between MDE status and other cMRI parameters that are depicted in our rules warrant further investigation and validation. Predictive rules learned from cMRI data to classify positive and negative findings of cardiomyopathy can enhance scientific understanding of the underlying interactions among imaging-derived parameters.",2,,26329721,17,,,,cMRI-BED: A novel informatics framework for cardiac MRI biomarker extraction and discovery applied to pediatric cardiomyopathy classification,,C

Tractography-based approaches can describe and analyze the anatomical area of CNs by selecting the reference streamlines in combination with ROIs-based (regions-of-interests) or clustering-based. However, due to the slender structure of CNs and the complex anatomical environment, single-modality data based on dMRI cannot provide a complete and accurate description, resulting in low accuracy or even failure of current algorithms in performing individualized CNs segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal deep-learning-based multi-class network for automated cranial nerves tract segmentation without using tractography, ROI placement or clustering, called CNTSeg. Specifically, we introduced T1w images, fractional anisotropy (FA) images, and fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks into the training data set, and design the back-end fusion module which uses the complementary information of the interphase feature fusion to improve the segmentation performance. CNTSeg has achieved the segmentation of 5 pairs of CNs (i.e. optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V, and facial–vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII).

The aim of this study is to assess the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging coupled with tissue-tracking technique (CMR-TT) and parametric mappings analysis in discriminating between TS and AM. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled three groups: patients with TS (n = 12), patients with AM (n = 14), and 10 healthy controls. All the patients had a comprehensive CMR examination, including the assessment of global and segmental longitudinal strain, circumferential strain, radial strain (RS), and parametric mapping. Results: The analysis of variance was used to compare the different groups. In TS patients, basal RS, global T1 mapping, global T2 mapping, mid T2 mapping, apical T1 and T2 mapping were statistically significantly different compared with the other groups. MANCOVA analysis confirmed that the association between myocardial strain data and parametric mapping was independent on age and sex. Apical T1 and T2 mapping proved to have a good performance in differentiating TS from AM (area under the curves of 0.908 and 0.879, respectively).

Frequently, TTS is related to severe emotional or physical stress and a subsequent increased adrenergic stimulation affecting cardiac function. Beyond clinical presentation, epidemiology, and novel diagnostic biomarkers, this review draws attention to potential pathophysiological mechanisms for the observed reversible myocardial dysfunction such as sympathetic overdrive-mediated multi-vessel epicardial spasms, microvascular dysfunction, the direct toxicity of catecholamines, lipotoxicity, and inflammation.

Observational studies that developed and/or validated multivariable diagnostic models to differentiate Takotsubo syndrome from ACS were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). We conducted a narrative synthesis of the performance measures of the diagnostic models evaluated in each study. In addition, a random-effects meta-analysis of the c-statistic with its 95% confidence interval (CI) of the InterTAK model was performed. Of 1015 articles, a total of 11 studies (n = 4552) were included. We identified eight new diagnostic models and eight were external validation of existing models. The most frequent model was InterTAK (n = 4). The reported c-statistic ranged from 0.77 to 0.97 across all models. Calibration plots were reported only for two models.

However, there is little information about the relationship between functional recovery and tissue characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the recovery process of TTS using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods: Consecutive patients with TTS were prospectively enrolled. We performed serial CMR in the acute phase (<72 h after admission), the subacute phase (7–10 days after admission) and the chronic phase (3 months later). To assess the degree of myocardial edema quantitatively, we evaluated the signal intensity of myocardium on T2-weighted images and calculated the signal intensity ratio compared with the skeletal muscle. Results: Fifteen patients with TTS were enrolled. CMR demonstrated reduced LV ejection fraction in the acute phase, and it recovered almost completely by the subacute phase. On the other hand, severe myocardial edema was still observed in the subacute phase, associated with increased LV mass. The highest signal intensity ratio in the subacute phase was correlated with the maximum voltage of negative T wave on electrocardiogram (r = 0.57, p = 0.03). Conclusions: In patients with TTS, myocardial edema associated with increased LV mass still remained in the subacute phase despite functional recovery of the LV.

Several pathophysiological explanations have been proposed for this syndrome and its intriguing appearance, and awareness is growing that these explanations might not be mutually exclusive. The reversible apical myocardial dysfunction observed might result from more than one pathophysiological phenomenon. The pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome is complex and integrates neuroendocrine physiology, potentially involving the cognitive centres of the brain, and including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Cardiovascular responses are caused by the sudden sympathetic activation and surge in concentrations of circulating catecholamines. The multiple morphological changes seen in the myocardium match those seen after catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity.

In this paper, a novel hybrid feature selection technique is proposed, which can reduce drastically the number of features with an acceptable loss of prediction accuracy. The proposed approach operates in multiple stages, starting by removing irrelevant features with a low discrimination power, and then eliminating the ones with low variation range. Afterward, among each set of features with high cross-correlation, a single feature that is strongly correlated with the output is kept. Finally, a Genetic Algorithm with a customized cost function is provided to select a small subset of the remainder of features.

Here we propose a SVR method that overcomes the shortcomings of previous work and produces state-of-the-art reconstructions in the presence of extreme inter-slice motion. Inspired by the recent success of single-view depth estimation methods we formulate SVR as a single-stack motion estimation task and train a fully convolutional network to predict a motion stack for a given slice stack producing a 3D reconstruction as a byproduct of the predicted motion. Extensive experiments on the SVR of adult and fetal brains demonstrate that our fully convolutional method is twice as accurate as previous SVR methods.

We assessed whether variance calculations of model metrics (e.g., AUROC, Sensitivity, Specificity) through bootstrap simulation and SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) could increase model transparency and improve model selection. Data from the England National Health Services Heart Disease Prediction Cohort was used. After comparison of model metrics for XGBoost, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Adaptive Boosting, XGBoost was used as the machine-learning model of choice in this study. Boost-strap simulation (N = 10,000) was used to empirically derive the distribution of model metrics and covariate Gain statistics. SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide explanations to machine-learning output and simulation to evaluate the variance of model accuracy metrics. For the XGBoost modeling method, we observed (through 10,000 completed simulations) that the AUROC ranged from 0.771 to 0.947, a difference of 0.176, the balanced accuracy ranged from 0.688 to 0.894, a 0.205 difference, the sensitivity ranged from 0.632 to 0.939, a 0.307 difference, and the specificity ranged from 0.595 to 0.944, a 0.394 difference. Among 10,000 simulations completed, we observed that the gain for Angina ranged from 0.225 to 0.456, a difference of 0.231, for Cholesterol ranged from 0.148 to 0.326, a difference of 0.178, for maximum heart rate (MaxHR) ranged from 0.081 to 0.200, a range of 0.119, and for Age ranged from 0.059 to 0.157, difference of 0.098. Use of simulations to empirically evaluate the variability of model metrics and explanatory algorithms to observe if covariates match the literature are necessary for increased transparency, reliability, and utility of machine learning methods.

Methods: CMR-feature tracking was performed blinded in a core laboratory to determine circumferential (CS), radial (RS) and longitudinal strain (LS) in 141 TTS patients participating in this cohort study. A subgroup of consecutive TTS patients (n = 20) was compared with age- and sex-matched controls with anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI as well as healthy subjects. Results: Median global CS, RS and LS were -19%, 19% and -12%, respectively. Apical ballooning was associated with significantly lower global CS (p < 0.01) and LS (p < 0.01) compared with midventricular and basal ballooning. Global RS was lowest in patients with basal ballooning (p < 0.01). Segmental analysis resulted in a reliable discrimination of different ballooning patterns using CS and LS. Strain values were significantly lower in TTS compared with non-STEMI patients and healthy subjects, whereas STEMI patients showed similar values. While global CS and RS were not associated with long-term mortality, global LS (cutoff -14.75%) was identified as a potential parameter for long-term risk stratification (mortality rate 17.9% versus 2.5%; p = 0.02). Conclusions: The transient contraction abnormalities in TTS can be quantitatively assessed with CMR-feature tracking. GLS is a potential determinant of outcome in TTS, which, however, requires further validation. Key Points: • Cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking enables accurate assessment of regional and global left ventricular dysfunction in Takotsubo syndrome (TTS). • Global strain in TTS is similar to patients with anterior STEMI and lower compared with non-STEMI and healthy subjects. • Global longitudinal strain is a potential tool for risk prediction in TTS patients.",12,5160-5170,29882071,38,,,,Left ventricular myocardial deformation in Takotsubo syndrome: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking study,,L

Suri,Luca Saba","Background: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is a key diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis between non-ischemic cause of cardiac chest pain. Some patients are not eligible for a gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR; in this scenario, the diagnosis remains challenging without invasive examination. Our purpose was to derive a machine learning model integrating some non-contrast CMR parameters and demographic factors to identify Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) in subjects with cardiac chest pain. Material and methods: Three groups of patients were retrospectively studied: TTC, acute myocarditis, and healthy controls. Global and regional left ventricular longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain (RS) analysis included were assessed. Reservoir, conduit, and booster bi-atrial functions were evaluated by tissue-tracking. Parametric mapping values were also assessed in all the patients. Five different tree-based ensemble learning algorithms were tested concerning their ability in recognizing TTC in a fully cross-validated framework. Results: The CMR-based machine learning (ML) ensemble model, by using the Extremely Randomized Trees algorithm with Elastic Net feature selection, showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 78–100), specificity of 86% (95% CI 80–92) and area under the ROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.99) in diagnosing TTC. Among non-contrast CMR parameters, the Shapley additive explanations analysis revealed that left atrial (LA) strain and strain rate were the top imaging markers in identifying TTC patients. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that using a tree-based ensemble learning algorithm on non-contrast CMR parameters and demographic factors enables the identification of subjects with TTC with good diagnostic accuracy. Translational outlook: Our results suggest that non-contrast CMR features can be implemented in a ML model to accurately identify TTC subjects. This model could be a valuable tool for aiding in the diagnosis of subjects with a contraindication to the contrast media. Furthermore, the left atrial conduit strain and strain rate were imaging markers that had a strong impact on TTC identification. Further prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to validate these findings and assess predictive performance in different cohorts, such as those with different ethnicities, and social backgrounds and undergoing different treatments.",,124-133,36410545,39,,,,"Machine learning approach in diagnosing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: The role of the combined evaluation of atrial and ventricular strain, and parametric mapping",,M

Therefore, this study aims to investigate ASD indicators using two types of magnetic resonance images (MRI), structural (sMRI) and functional (fMRI), and to address the issue of limited data availability. Transfer learning is a valuable technique when working with limited data, as it utilizes knowledge gained from a pre-trained model in a domain with abundant data. This study proposed the use of four vision transformers namely ConvNeXT, MobileNet, Swin, and ViT using sMRI modalities. The study also investigated the use of a 3D-CNN model with sMRI and fMRI modalities. Our experiments involved different methods of generating data and extracting slices from raw 3D sMRI and 4D fMRI scans along the axial, coronal, and sagittal brain planes. To evaluate our methods, we utilized a standard neuroimaging dataset called NYU from the ABIDE repository to classify ASD subjects from typical control subjects. The performance of our models was evaluated against several baselines including studies that implemented VGG and ResNet transfer learning models. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-slice generation with the 3D-CNN and transfer learning methods as they achieved state-of-the-art results.

This review focuses on the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms that could be involved in the occurrence takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Main body: Acute stress and subsequent excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system are major factors in the pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The high levels of catecholamine work in a triggering manner, generate reactive oxygen species, release inflammatory cytokines, and induce endothelial injury. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has increased following COVID-19 infection and vaccination, which suggests that neurohormonal and psychological factors (i.e., fear and anxiety of infection or vaccination) may have an additional role in the pathophysiology. In addition, inflammatory state, cytokine storm, augmented sympathetic activity, and endothelial dysfunction during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection may participate in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Chronic stress is also linked to this complex mechanism by accelerating cripple of endocrinal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, which influences the cortisol effect on releasing catecholamine, which is directly related to the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: The excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system and subsequent high levels of catecholamines could initiate the process. The catecholamines, in turn, generate reactive oxygen species and release inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, CXCL1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), which causes endothelial injury.",,,,45,,,,Pathophysiology of stress cardiomyopathy: A comprehensive literature review,,P

Tobis","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), a persistently obscure dysfunctional condition of the left ventricle, is uniquely transient but nevertheless dangerous. It features variable ventricular patterns and is predominant in women. For 30 years, pathophysiologic investigations have progressed only slowly and with inadequate focus. It was initially proposed that sudden-onset spastic obliteration of coronary flow induced myocardial ischemia with residual stunning and thus TTC. Later, it was generally accepted without proof that, in the presence of pain or emotional stress, the dominant mechanism for TTC onset was a catecholamine surge that had a direct, toxic myocardial effect. We think that the manifestations of TTC are more dynamic and complex than can be assumed from catecholamine effects alone. In addition, after reviewing the recent medical literature and considering our own clinical observations, especially on spasm, we theorize that atherosclerotic coronary artery disease modulates and physically opposes obstruction during spasm. This phenomenon may explain the midventricular variant of TTC and the lower incidence of TTC in men. We continue to recommend and perform acetylcholine testing to reproduce TTC and to confirm our theory that coronary spasm is its initial pathophysiologic factor. An improved understanding of TTC is especially important because of the condition’s markedly increased incidence during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This task has several challenges: (1) it has to be carried out in real-time; (2) it should not require manual intervention; (3) it requires multimodal operation; (4) it should not require landmark; and (5) it should not require initialization. However, available methods are incapable of overcoming these obstacles simultaneously. In this study, a discrete strategy is introduced, and the slice-to-volume registration is transformed into a global multilabel classification problem. An automatic system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to implement multilabel classification. The network is trained by slices extracted from the volume and applied in a multibranch manner. Moreover, silhouettes are utilized to unify the multimodal images into the same metric. Centralization and spindle transformation are applied to reduce the dimension of the parameter space, resulting in fewer training samples and less computational complexity. This system exhibits the advantages of not requiring initialization, landmark, or manual intervention; moreover, it can satisfy the real-time and multimodal requirements simultaneously. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our system can achieve highly accurate registration and strong robustness; moreover, it is observed to be superior to the state-of-the-art methods by an average of approximately 4.5 mm in terms of the mean target registration error.",,86-96,,53,,,,Real-time and multimodal brain slice-to-volume registration using CNN,,R

Even for hybrid (2D + 3D) approaches, the intrinsic disadvantages within the 2D / 3D parts still exist. In this study, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D convolutions by reinventing the 2D convolutions. We propose ACS (axial-coronal-sagittal) convolutions to perform natively 3D representation learning, while utilizing the pretrained weights on 2D datasets. In ACS convolutions, 2D convolution kernels are split by channel into three parts, and convoluted separately on the three views (axial, coronal and sagittal) of 3D representations. Theoretically, ANY 2D CNN (ResNet, DenseNet, or DeepLab) is able to be converted into a 3D ACS CNN, with pretrained weight of a same parameter size. Extensive experiments on several medical benchmarks (including classification, segmentation and detection tasks) validate the consistent superiority of the pretrained ACS CNNs, over the 2D / 3D CNN counterparts with / without pretraining. Even without pretraining, the ACS convolution can be used as a plug-and-play replacement of standard 3D convolution, with smaller model size and less computation.",,,,56,,,,Reinventing 2D Convolutions for 3D Images,,R

In the medical field, there are numerous applications of AI and subsequently, in a relatively short time, significant progress has been made. Cardiology is not immune to this trend, this fact being supported by the exponential increase in the number of publications in which the algorithms play an important role in data analysis, pattern discovery, identification of anomalies, and therapeutic decision making. Furthermore, with technological development, there have appeared new models of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DP) that are capable of exploring various applications of AI in cardiology, including areas such as prevention, cardiovascular imaging, electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, and many others. In this sense, the present article aims to provide a general vision of the current state of AI use in cardiology. Results: We identified and included a subset of 200 papers directly relevant to the current research covering a wide range of applications. Thus, this paper presents AI applications in cardiovascular imaging, arithmology, clinical or emergency cardiology, cardiovascular prevention, and interventional procedures in a summarized manner. Recent studies from the highly scientific literature demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using AI in different branches of cardiology. Conclusions: The integration of AI in cardiology offers promising perspectives for increasing accuracy by decreasing the error rate and increasing efficiency in cardiovascular practice. From predicting the risk of sudden death or the ability to respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or the early detection of valvular diseases, AI algorithms have shown their potential to mitigate human error and provide feasible solutions. At the same time, limits imposed by the small samples studied are highlighted alongside the challenges presented by ethical implementation; these relate to legal implications regarding responsibility and decision making processes, ensuring patient confidentiality and data security.

However, the progressive nature  of AD makes it challenging to identify its causal factors. Modern diagnostic workflows for AD use  cognitive tests, neurological examinations, and biomarker-based methods, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. While these methods are effective,  non-invasive imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining importance. Deep  Learning (DL) approaches for evaluating alterations in brain structure have focused on combining MRI  and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the spatial architecture of DL. This combination  has garnered significant research interest due to its remarkable effectiveness in automating feature  extraction across various multilayer perceptron models. Despite this, MRI’s noisy and multidimensional  nature requires an intelligent preprocessing pipeline for effective disease prediction. Our study aims  to detect different stages of AD from the multidimensional neuroimaging data obtained through  MRI scans using 2D and 3D CNN architectures. The proposed preprocessing pipeline comprises  skull stripping, spatial normalization, and smoothing. It is followed by a novel and efficient pixel  count-based frame selection and cropping approach, which renders a notable dimension reduction.  Furthermore, the learnable resizer method is applied to enhance the image quality while resizing the  data. Finally, the proposed shallow 2D and 3D CNN architectures extract spatio-temporal attributes  from the segmented MRI data. Furthermore, we merged both the CNNs for further comparative  analysis. Notably, 2D CNN achieved a maximum accuracy of 93%, while 3D CNN reported the highest  accuracy of 96.5%.",,,,58,,,,Stages prediction of Alzheimer’s disease with shallow 2D and 3D CNNs from intelligently selected neuroimaging data,,S

This systematic review evaluated the T1 and T2 parametric mapping to delineate the current diagnostic and prognostic CMR imaging outcomes in TTS. Methods: A comprehensive literature search until October 2023 was performed on ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library by two independent reviewers adhering to the PRISMA framework. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies. Results: Out of 198 results, 8 studies were included in this qualitative synthesis, accounting for a total population of 399 subjects (TTS = 201, controls = 175, acute myocarditis = 14, and acute regional myocardial oedema without infarction = 9). Approximately 50.4 % were TTS patients aged between 61 and 73 years, whereof, females (n = 181, 90.0 %) and apical variants (n = 180, 89.6 %) were significantly higher, and emotional stressor (n = 42; 20.9 %) was more prevalent than physical (n = 27; 13.4 %). The NOS identified 62.5 % of studies as moderate and 37.5 % as high quality. Parametric tissue mapping revealed significantly prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times at 1.5T and 3T respectively in TTS (1053–1164 msec, 1292–1438 msec; and 56–67 msec, 60–90 msec) with higher extracellular volume (ECV) fraction (29–36 %), compared to healthy subjects (944–1211 msec, 1189–1251 msec; and 46–54 msec, 32–68 msec; 23–29 %) and myocarditis (1058 msec, 60 msec). Other significant myocardial abnormalities included increased left ventricular (LV) end-systolic and diastolic volume and reduced global longitudinal strain. Overall, myocardial oedema, altered LV mass and strain, and worse LV systolic function, with higher native T1, T2, and ECV values were consistent. Conclusions: Future research with substantially larger clinical trials is vital to explore the CMR imaging findings in diverse TTS patient cohorts and correlate the T1 and T2 mapping outcomes with demographic/clinical covariates. CMR is a valuable imaging tool for TTS diagnosis and prognostication.

Many emotional, or physical stressors can trigger SCM, and have been able to describe an interplay of neurohormonal and inflammatory mechanisms as the pathophysiology of this disease.

TS is characterized by contractile dysfunction, which usually affects the apical region of the heart, lack of coronary artery obstruction, moderate increase in myocardial necrosis markers, prolonged QTc interval (in 50% of patients), sometimes elevation of ST segment (in 19% of patients), increase N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide level, microvascular dysfunction, sometimes spasm of the epicardial coronary arteries (in 10% of patients), myocardial edema, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (in 11% of patients). Stress cardiomyopathy is a rare disease, it is observed in 0.6 - 2.5% of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The occurrence of takotsubo syndrome is 9 times higher in women, who are aged 60-70 years old , than in men. The hospital mortality among patients with TS corresponds to 3.5% - 12%. In many patients with TS, but not in all, physical or emotional stress precedes the disease. Many patients with TS, but not all, have neurological or mental illnesses. The level of catecholamines is increased in patients with TS, therefore, the occurrence of TS is associated with the excessive activation of the adrenergic system. The negative inotropic effect of catecholamines is associated with the activation of β2 adrenergic receptors. An important role of the adrenergic system in the pathogenesis of TS is confirmed by studies which were performed using 125I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (125I -MIBG). TS causes edema and inflammation of the myocardium. The inflammatory response in TS is systemic. TS causes impaired coronary microcirculation and reduces coronary reserve. There is reason to believe that an increase in blood viscosity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of microcirculatory dysfunction in patients with TS. Epicardial coronary artery spasm is not obligatory for the occurrence of TS. Cortisol, endothelin-1 and microRNAs are challengers for the role of TS triggers. A decrease in estrogen levels is a factor contributing to the onset of TS.

Methods: We retrospectively selected 50 patients with TTS clinical-radiological diagnosis who underwent CMR within 30 days since symptoms onset: 19 studied during the early subacute phase (sTTS, ≤ 7 days) and 31 during the convalescence (cTTS, 8–30 days). We measured the following: LV global longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain (lvGLS, lvGCS, lvGRS) and strain rate (SR) and LA reservoir (laS_r), conduit (laS_cd), and booster pump strain (laS_bp) and strain rate (laSR_r, laSR_cd, laSR_bp). Patients were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched controls. Results: All patients were women (mean age 63 years). TTS patients showed altered LV- and LA-strain features, compared to controls. sTTS was associated with increased laS_bp (12.7% versus 9.8%) and reduced lvEF (47.4% versus 54.8%), lvGLS (-12.2% versus 14.6%), and laS_cd (7.0% versus 9.5%) compared to cTTS (p ≤ 0.029). The interval between symptoms onset and CMR was correlated with laS_bp (r = -0.49) and lvGLS (r = 0.47) (p = 0.001 for both). At receiver operating characteristics analysis, laS_bp was the best discriminator between sTTS and cTTS (area under the curve [AUC] 0.815), followed by lvGLS (AUC 0.670). Conclusions: LA dysfunction persists during the subacute and convalescence of TTS. laS_bp increases in subacute phase with progressive decrease during convalescence, representing a compensatory mechanism of LV dysfunction and thus a useful index of functional recovery. Relevance statement: Atrial strain has the potential to enhance the delineation of cardiac injury and functional impairment in TTS patients, assisting in the identification of individuals at higher risk and facilitating the implementation of more targeted and personalized medical therapies. Key points: • In TTS, after ventricular recovery, atrial dysfunction persists assessable with CMR feature tracking. • Quantitative assessment of atrial strain discriminates atrial functions: reservoir, conduit, and booster pump. • Atrial booster pump changes after acute TTS, regardless of ventricular function. • Atrial strain may serve as a temporal marker in TTS.

TTS is more common in post-menopausal women, closely resembling acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in its clinical presentation, with multiple proposed underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and no evidence-based treatments. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest research, encompassing the pathophysiology, diagnostic findings, prognosis, and treatment options for TTS patients. Methods: Relevant literature from 1990 to June 2023 on TTS epidemiology, physiopathology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prognosis was retrieved through PubMed research. Only English publications were included. Key Content and Findings: TTS is an increasingly recognized cardiovascular disorder, a significant release of catecholamines is thought to be a key contributing element, yet its exact mechanism remains unclear. Notably, TTS poses significant short and long-term risks akin to ACS. Initial treatment should focus on ruling out ACS and providing standard care for subsequent left ventricular dysfunction and complications. Research hints at a potential role for Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers in improving long-term prognosis in TTS patients. Conclusions: Significant knowledge gaps still exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment options, and areas for improvement in diagnosing and prognosticating this intriguing condition. Further research is therefore needed.",6,1080-1103,,71,,,,Takotsubo syndrome: unravelling the enigma of the broken heart syndrome?—a narrative review,,T

Methods: This retrospective, IRB-approved study included 32 patients with known HCM. Thirty patients with normal CMR served as controls. Regions-of-interest for TA encompassing the left ventricle were drawn on short-axis non-contrast T1-weighted images using a freely available software package. Step-wise dimension reduction and texture feature selection was performed for selecting features enabling the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in HCM patients on non-contrast T1-weighted CMR images. Results: Comparing HCM patients and controls, four texture features were identified showing significant differences between groups (Grey-level Non-uniformity [GLevNonU]: 74 ± 17 vs. 38 ± 9, p <.001; Energy of wavelet coefficients in low-frequency sub-bands [WavEnLL]: 58 ± 5 vs. 48 ± 10, p <.001; Fraction: 0.70 ± 0.07 vs. 0.78 ± 0.05, p <.001; Sum Average: 16.6 ± 0.4 vs. 17.0 ± 0.5, p =.007). A model containing the single parameter GLevNonU proved to be the best for differentiating between HCM patients and controls with a sensitivity/specificity of 91%/93%. A cut-off of GLevNonU ≥46 allowed for distinguishing HCM patients from controls with a sensitivity/specificity of 94%/90%. Even in patients without late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), the defined cut-off led to a differentiation of LGE- patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Conclusions: TA on non-contrast T1-weighted images allows for the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in the setting of HCM with excellent accuracy, delivering potential novel parameters for a non-contrast assessment of myocardial texture alterations.",,61-67,29685546,72,,,,Texture analysis and machine learning of non-contrast T1-weighted MR images in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy—Preliminary results,,T

The Brier score has been recommended on the grounds that it is a proper scoring rule that is affected by both discrimination and calibration. However, the Brier score is prevalence dependent in such a way that the rank ordering of tests or models may inappropriately vary by prevalence. We explored four common clinical scenarios: comparison of a highly accurate binary test with a continuous prediction model of moderate predictiveness; comparison of two binary tests where the importance of sensitivity versus specificity is inversely associated with prevalence; comparison of models and tests to default strategies of assuming that all or no patients are positive; and comparison of two models with miscalibration in opposite directions. In each case, we found that the Brier score gave an inappropriate rank ordering of the tests and models. Conversely, net benefit, a decision-analytic measure, gave results that always favored the preferable&nbsp;test or model.

A growing body of evidence shows that LA is involved in several cardiovascular diseases from a clinical and prognostic standpoint. LA enlargement has been recognized as a predictor of the outcomes of many diseases. However, LA enlargement itself does not explain the whole LA's function during the cardiac cycle. For this reason, the recently proposed assessment of atrial strain at advanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) enables the usual limitations of the sole LA volumetric measurement to be overcome. Moreover, the left atrial strain impairment might allow several cardiovascular diseases to be detected at an earlier stage. While traditional CMR has a central role in assessing LA volume and, through cine sequences, a marginal role in evaluating LA function, feature tracking at advanced CMR (CMR-FT) has been increasingly confirmed as a feasible and reproducible technique for assessing LA function through strain. In comparison to atrial function evaluations via speckle tracking echocardiography, CMR-FT has a higher spatial resolution, larger field of view, and better reproducibility. In this literature review on atrial strain analysis, we describe the strengths, limitations, recent applications, and promising developments of studying atrial function using CMR-FT in clinical practice. Key Points • The left atrium has a crucial function in maintaining left ventricular filling; left atrial size has been recognized as a predictor of the outcomes of many diseases. • Left atrial strain has been confirmed as a marker of atrial functional status and demonstrated to be a sensitive tool in the subclinical phase of a disease. • A comprehensive evaluation of the three phases of atrial function by CMR-FT demonstrates an impairment before the onset of atrial enlargement, thus helping clinicians in their decision-making and improving patient outcomes.",,,,74,,,,The emerging role of atrial strain assessed by cardiac MRI in different cardiovascular settings: an up-to-date review,,T

Because TTC often mimics acute myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary disease, the condition is often underdiagnosed in the population. Our aim was to discuss the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in diagnosing TTC. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception until April 8, 2023, for studies on the utility of AI- or ML-based algorithms in diagnosing TTC compared with other cardiovascular diseases or healthy controls. We summarized major findings in a narrative fashion and tabulated relevant numerical parameters. Results: Five studies with a total of 920 patients were included. Four hundred and forty-seven were diagnosed with TTC via International Classification of Diseases codes or the Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria, while there were 473 patients in the comparator group (29 of healthy controls, 429 of myocardial infarction, and 14 of acute myocarditis). Hypertension and smoking were the most common comorbidities in both cohorts, but there were no statistical differences between TTC and comparators. Two studies utilized deep-learning algorithms on transthoracic echocardiographic images, while the rest incorporated supervised ML on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 12-lead electrocardiographs, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. All studies found that AI-based algorithms can increase the diagnostic rate of TTC when compared to healthy controls or myocardial infarction patients. In three of these studies, AI-based algorithms had higher sensitivity and specificity compared to human readers. Conclusion: AI and ML algorithms can improve the diagnostic capacity of TTC and additionally reduce erroneous human error in differentiating from MI and healthy individuals.",3,165-176,,75,,,,The Utility of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Diagnosis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review,,T

In a field where accountability is indispensable, the prime reason why medical practitioners are still reluctant to utilize AI models, is the reliability of these models. However, explainable AI (XAI) was a game changing discovery where the so-called back boxes can be interpreted using Explainability algorithms. The proposed conceptual model reviews the existing recent researches for AI in heartcare that have found success in the past few years. The various techniques explored range from clinical history analysis, medical imaging to the nonlinear dynamic theory of chaos to metabolomics with specific focus on machine learning, deep learning and Explainability. The model also comprehensively surveys the different modalities of datasets used in heart disease prediction focusing on how results differ based on the different datasets along with the publicly available datasets for experimentation. The review will be an eye opener for medical researchers to quickly identify the current progress and to identify the most reliable data and AI algorithm that is appropriate for a particular technology for heartcare along with the Explainability algorithm suitable for the specific task.",6,,,77,,,,Towards explainability in artificial intelligence frameworks for heartcare: A comprehensive survey,,T

Avakyan","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS) has become a recognised clinical entity since the Japanese scientist Sato first described it in 1990. Despite an increasing number of confirmed cases, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and decision-making differs in the diagnosis and treatment. In addition, it is not evident whether a significant increase in TTS is due to better understanding among practitioners and widespread access to coronary angiography, or if it is a reflection of an actual increase in incidence. We analysed a series of international research studies from 1990 to 2021. Beyond epidemiology and clinical presentation, we evaluated and summarised fundamental knowledge about various predisposing factors, with particular attention to the iatrogenic impact of certain drugs, namely antidepressants, chemotherapy, and antiarrhythmics. Furthermore, we highlighted the main pathophysiological theories to date. In addition, based on published studies and clinical cases, we investigated the role of numerous diagnostic approaches in the differential diagnosis of TTS and identified predictors of TTS complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular fibrillation, and left ventricular thrombi. Accordingly, we sought to propose a diagnostic algorithm and further treatment management of TTS under the presence of possible complications to help practitioners make more informed decisions, as the initial presentation continues to pose a challenge due to its close similarity to acute coronary syndrome with ST-elevation. In conclusion, this article examines Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from different perspectives and, along with future systematic reviews and meta-analyses, can be of particular interest to practising cardiologists and researchers in developing clinical guidelines.",,,,78,,,,Update of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: Present experience and outlook for the future,,U

Current state-of-the-art methods rely on CNNs to address this problem. Recently, we witness two types of CNNs being developed: CNNs based upon volumetric representations versus CNNs based upon multi-view representations. Empirical results from these two types of CNNs exhibit a large gap, indicating that existing volumetric CNN architectures and approaches are unable to fully exploit the power of 3D representations. In this paper, we aim to improve both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs according to extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce two distinct network architectures of volumetric CNNs. In addition, we examine multi-view CNNs, where we introduce multi-resolution filtering in 3D. Overall, we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods for both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs.
