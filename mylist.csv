1,A,A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions,Done,"AI, ML",2017,,,,,"Paul G Allen, Scott M Lundberg, Su-In Lee","Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.","Artificial Intelligence, Explainability, Machine Learning",,https://github.com/slundberg/shap,,,

The precise pathophysiological mechanism of TTS is still unknown, but recent evidence suggests a central role of systemic inflammation associated with adrenergic discharge. Although initially considered benign, TTS has shown several potential short-term and long-term complications and adverse outcomes. To improve understanding and management, advanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques, such as feature tracking (FT) and parametric mapping, have gained attention. Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the clinical applications of CMR-FT and mapping in TTS. Additionally, the most significant and recent findings will be discussed. Recent Findings: FT-CMR enables the parametric quantification of myocardial deformation, allowing a comprehensive evaluation of left ventricular, right ventricular, and atrial function. It provides an accurate definition of areas of myocardial dysfunction and potentially serves as a superior prognostic tool compared to ejection fraction. Tissue mapping techniques enable precise and comprehensive tissue characterization by quantifying areas of oedema, and myocardial fibrosis. Summary: FT-CMR and mapping techniques serve as valuable prognostic tools both in the acute and chronic phases of TTS. They can detect subtle alterations and pan-cardiac involvement, while also providing important insights into the complex underlying mechanisms of the syndrome.","Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Feature Tracking, Mapping, Takotsubo","Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,Feature Tracking,Mapping,Takotsubo",,19419074,10.1007/s12410-024-09593-9,"Summarize current literature on clinical applications of CMR-FT and mapping in TS, discuss their significant and recent findings and their clinical utility.

In cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) the application of AI is focused on post-processing and particularly on the segmentation of cardiac chambers during late gadolinium enhancement. In echocardiography, the application of AI is focused on segmentation of cardiac chambers and is helpful for valvular function and wall motion abnormalities.

Suri, Lorenzo Mannelli, Luca Saba, Mariano Scaglione, Riccardo Cau, Salvatore Masala","In recent years, cardiovascular imaging examinations have experienced exponential growth due to technological innovation, and this trend is consistent with the most recent chest pain guidelines. Contrast media have a crucial role in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, allowing for more precise characterization of different cardiovascular diseases. However, contrast media have contraindications and side effects that limit their clinical application in determinant patients. The application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to CMR imaging has led to the development of non-contrast models. These AI models utilize non-contrast imaging data, either independently or in combination with clinical and demographic data, as input to generate diagnostic or prognostic algorithms. In this review, we provide an overview of the main concepts pertaining to AI, review the existing literature on non-contrast AI models in CMR, and finally, discuss the strengths and limitations of these AI models and their possible future development.","Ai, Cardiovascular Imaging, Cmr, Non-contrast Images","AI,CMR,cardiovascular imaging,non-contrast images",,20754418,10.3390/diagnostics13122061,

6,A,Atrial Impairment as a Marker in Discriminating between Takotsubo and Acute Myocarditis Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance,Not started,,2022,,,,,"Christian Loewe, Jasjit S. Suri, Luca Saba, Michele Porcu, Pierluigi Ciet, Riccardo Cau, Valeria Cherchi","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively compare the left and right atrium strain and strain rate (SR) parameters by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) between patients with Takotsubo (TS) and patients with acute myocarditis (AM). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 3 groups of patients: TS (n=18), AM (n=14), and 11 healthy subjects. All the patients had complete CMR data for features tracking assessment. Differences in reservoir, conduit strain (ϵe), conduit strain rate (SRe), and booster phase of biatrial strain were analyzed between the groups using analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of covariance analyses. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility was assessed for all strain and SR parameters using intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Atrial strain was feasible in all patients and controls. In TS, left atrium (LA) reservoir strain (ϵs), reservoir SR, ϵe, and SRe were significantly lower compared with the other groups (P=0,001 for all). multivariate analysis of covariance analysis showed association of these parameters after correction for age and sex, while LA booster deformation (ϵaand SRa) strain parameters were preserved. LA SRe proved to have excellent sensitivity in differentiating patients with TS from those with AM (areas under the curves of 0.903, 95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.99). Biatrial strain and SR parameters showed good (excellent) intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility (ranged between 0.61 to 0.96 and 0.50 to 0.90, respectively). Conclusion: Compared with AM, patients with TS showed significantly decreased LA reservoir, conduit strain, and SR parameters. Therefore, LA strain assessment may have a role in discriminating between TS and AM.","Atrial Strain, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, Myocarditis, Takotsubo","Takotsubo,atrial strain,cardiac magnetic resonance,myocarditis",,15360237,10.1097/RTI.0000000000000650,

Since atrial involvement may have a significant role, we assessed the diagnostic and prognostic potential of atrial cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) in TTS. Methods and results: This multicentre study recruited 152 TTS patients who underwent CMR on average within 3 days after hospitalization. Reservoir [total strain ϵs and peak positive strain rate (SR) SRs], conduit (passive strain ϵe and peak early negative SRe), and booster pump function (active strain ϵa and peak late negative SRa) were assessed in a core laboratory. Results were compared with 21 control patients with normal biventricular function. A total of 20 patients underwent follow-up CMR (median 3.5 months, interquartile range 3-5). All patients were approached for general follow-up. Left atrial (LA) but not right atrial (RA) reservoir and conduit function were impaired during the acute phase (ϵs: P = 0.043, ϵe: P < 0.001, SRe: P = 0.047 vs. controls) and recovered until follow-up (ϵs: P < 0.001, SRs: P = 0.04, ϵe: P = 0.001, SRe: P = 0.04). LA and RA booster pump function were increased in the acute setting (LA-ϵa: P = 0.045, SRa: P = 0.002 and RA-ϵa: P = 0.004, SRa: P = 0.002 vs. controls). LA-ϵs predicted mortality [hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.20; P = 0.037] irrespectively of established cardiovascular risk factors (P = 0.019, multivariate analysis) including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (area under the curve 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.86, P = 0.048).

Method: Eighteen TS patients and 13 healthy controls were studied. Reservoir, conduit, and booster bi-atrial functions were analyzed by CMR-FT. The correlation between LA and RA strain parameters was assessed. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated for all strain and strain rate (SR) parameters using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Atrial strain were feasible in all patients and controls. Takotsubo patients showed an impaired LA Reservoir strain (∊s), LA Reservoir strain rate (SRs), LA and RA Conduit strain(∊e), LA and RA conduit strain rate (SRe) in comparison with controls (P < 0.001 for all of them), while no differences were found as to LA and RA booster deformation parameters (∊a and SRa). Analysis of correlation showed that LA ∊s, SRs, ∊e, and SRe were positively correlated with corresponding RA strain measurements (P < 0.001, r = 0.61 and P = 0,03, r = 0,54, respectively). Reproducibility was good to excellent for all atrial strain and strain rate parameters (ICCs ranging from 0,50 to 0,96).

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.","Aggregation Bootstrap, Averaging, Combining","Aggregation Bootstrap,Averaging,Combining",,,,

Materials and Methods: A total of 80 patients were included in the analysis: 30 patients with apical ballooning TTC and 50 patients with AMI. Global and regional ventricular function, including longitudinal (LS), circumferential (CS), and radial strain (RS), were assessed using CMR. The base-to-apex LS, RS, and CS gradients, defined as the peak gradient difference between averaged basal and apical strain, were calculated. Results: The base-to-apex RS gradient was impaired in TTC patients compared with the AMI group (14.04 ± 15.50 vs. -0.43 ± 11.59, P=0.001). Conversely, there were no significant differences in the base-to-apex LS and CS gradients between the AMI group and TTC patients (0.14 ± 2.71 vs. -1.5 ± 3.69, P=0.054: -0.99 ± 6.49 vs. ±1.4 ± 5.43, P=0.47, respectively). Beyond the presence and extension of LGE, base-to-apex RS gradient was the only independent discriminator between TTC and AMI (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.08, 1.52, P=0.006) in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that the pattern of regional myocardial strain impairment could serve as an additional noncontrast CMR tool to refine the diagnosis of TTC.

Little is known about the pathophysiology of TTC. We assessed admission plasma concentrations of biomarkers reflecting neuroendocrine response (copeptin, mid-regional-pro-adrenomedullin, pro-atrial-natriuretic-peptide, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), syndecan-1) and inflammation (suppression-of-tumorigenicity 2 (ST2), high-sensitive C-reactive-protein) in TTC patients and compared to patients with acute anterior STEMI. Materials and methods: Twenty TTC patients were matched with 40 STEMI patients by age, gender and left ventricular ejection fraction. Blood was sampled upon hospital admission immediately before acute coronary angiography. Results: The groups had similar comorbidities.

Among noninvasive imaging techniques, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming increasingly important in evaluating patients with TS. CMR offers a unique ability to noninvasively assess myocardial tissue characteristics, allowing for detecting the typical features of TS, such as specific wall motion abnormalities and myocardial edema. Beyond its well-established diagnostic utility in the clinical management of TS, CMR has also proven valuable in prognosis and risk stratification for these patients. Advances in CMR, including myocardial strain and parametric mapping have expanded its role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of these patients. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential applications of CMR in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of TS patients. It explores the emerging use of novel CMR imaging biomarkers that may enhance diagnosis, improve prognostic accuracy, and contribute to the overall management of these patients.","Cmr, Imaging, Prognosis, Takotsubo","CMR,Takotsubo,imaging,prognosis",,15408175,10.1111/echo.15949,

Methods: This retrospective study evaluated CMR scans of 107 consecutive patients (49 ICM, 58 NICM), including atrial and ventricular strain parameters. We used these data to compare an explainable tree-based gradient boosting additive model with four traditional ML models for the differentiation of ICM and NICM. The models were trained and internally validated with repeated cross-validation according to discrimination and calibration. Furthermore, we examined important variables for distinguishing between ICM and NICM. Results: A total of 107 patients and 38 variables were available for the analysis. Of those, 49 were ICM (34 males, mean age 60 ± 9 years) and 58 patients were NICM (38 males, mean age 56 ± 19 years). After 10 repetitions of the tenfold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved the highest area under curve (0.82, 95% CI [0.47–1.00]) and lowest Brier score (0.19, 95% CI [0.13–0.27]), showing competitive diagnostic accuracy and calibration. At the Youden’s index, sensitivity was 0.72 (95% CI [0.68–0.76]), the highest of all. Analysis of predictions revealed that both atrial and ventricular strain CMR parameters were important for the identification of ICM patients. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that using a ML model, multi chamber myocardial strain, and function on non-contrast CMR parameters enables the discrimination between ICM and NICM with competitive diagnostic accuracy. Clinical relevance statement: A machine learning model based on non-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters may discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy enabling wider access to cardiovascular magnetic resonance examinations with lower costs and faster imaging acquisition. Key Points: • The exponential growth in cardiovascular magnetic resonance examinations may require faster and more cost-effective protocols. • Artificial intelligence models can be utilized to distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies. • Machine learning using non-contrast CMR parameters can effectively distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.

14,C,cMRI-BED: A novel informatics framework for cardiac MRI biomarker extraction and discovery applied to pediatric cardiomyopathy classification,Not started,,2015,,,,,"Prahlad G. Menon, Shobhit Madan, Vanathi Gopalakrishnan","Background: Pediatric cardiomyopathies are a rare, yet heterogeneous group of pathologies of the myocardium that are routinely examined clinically using Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). This gold standard powerful non-invasive tool yields high resolution temporal images that characterize myocardial tissue. The complexities associated with the annotation of images and extraction of markers, necessitate the development of efficient workflows to acquire, manage and transform this data into actionable knowledge for patient care to reduce mortality and morbidity. Methods: We develop and test a novel informatics framework called cMRI-BED for biomarker extraction and discovery from such complex pediatric cMRI data that includes the use of a suite of tools for image processing, marker extraction and predictive modeling. We applied our workflow to obtain and analyze a dataset of 83 de-identified cases and controls containing cMRI-derived biomarkers for classifying positive versus negative findings of cardiomyopathy in children. Bayesian rule learning (BRL) methods were applied to derive understandable models in the form of propositional rules with posterior probabilities pertaining to their validity. Popular machine learning methods in the WEKA data mining toolkit were applied using default parameters to assess cross-validation performance of this dataset using accuracy and percentage area under ROC curve (AUC) measures. Results: The best 10-fold cross validation predictive performance obtained on this cMRI-derived biomarker dataset was 80.72% accuracy and 79.6% AUC by a BRL decision tree model, which is promising from this type of rare data. Moreover, we were able to verify that mycocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) status, which is known to be an important qualitative factor in the classification of cardiomyopathies, is picked up by our rule models as an important variable for prediction. Conclusions: Preliminary results show the feasibility of our framework for processing such data while also yielding actionable predictive classification rules that can augment knowledge conveyed in cardiac radiology outcome reports. Interactions between MDE status and other cMRI parameters that are depicted in our rules warrant further investigation and validation. Predictive rules learned from cMRI data to classify positive and negative findings of cardiomyopathy can enhance scientific understanding of the underlying interactions among imaging-derived parameters.",,,,1475925X,10.1186/1475-925X-14-S2-S7,

Acute myocarditis (AM) is usually included in TS differential diagnosis. The aim of this study is to assess the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging coupled with tissue-tracking technique (CMR-TT) and parametric mappings analysis in discriminating between TS and AM. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively enrolled three groups: patients with TS (n = 12), patients with AM (n = 14), and 10 healthy controls. All the patients had a comprehensive CMR examination, including the assessment of global and segmental longitudinal strain, circumferential strain, radial strain (RS), and parametric mapping. Results: The analysis of variance was used to compare the different groups. In TS patients, basal RS, global T1 mapping, global T2 mapping, mid T2 mapping, apical T1 and T2 mapping were statistically significantly different compared with the other groups. MANCOVA analysis confirmed that the association between myocardial strain data and parametric mapping was independent on age and sex. Apical T1 and T2 mapping proved to have a good performance in differentiating TS from AM (area under the curves of 0.908 and 0.879, respectively).

Considering its acute clinical presentation, coronary angiography with left ventriculography constitutes the gold standard diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm TTS. Frequently, TTS is related to severe emotional or physical stress and a subsequent increased adrenergic stimulation affecting cardiac function. Beyond clinical presentation, epidemiology, and novel diagnostic biomarkers, this review draws attention to potential pathophysiological mechanisms for the observed reversible myocardial dysfunction such as sympathetic overdrive-mediated multi-vessel epicardial spasms, microvascular dysfunction, the direct toxicity of catecholamines, lipotoxicity, and inflammation. Considering the long-term prognosis, further experimental and clinical research is indispensable to elucidate further pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TTS before randomized control trials with evidence-based therapeutic management can be performed.","Acute Heart Failure, Biomarker, Broken Heart Syndrome, Inflammation, Lipotoxicity, Takotsubo Syndrome","Acute heart failure,Biomarker,Broken heart syndrome,Inflammation,Lipotoxicity,Takotsubo syndrome",,20770383,10.3390/jcm10030479,

However, there is a gap in evidence and there are no randomized and adequately powered studies on clinical effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. Some evidence supports the use ACE-inhibitors/ARBs at long-term. A tailored approach based on cardiovascular and noncardiovascular risk factors is strongly suggested for long-term management. The urgent need for evidence-based treatment approaches is also reflected by the prognosis following TTS. The acute phase of the disease can be accompanied by various cardiovascular complications.

Hernandez, Carlos Diaz-Arocutipa, Cesar Joel Benites-Moya, Javier Torres-Valencia, Lourdes Vicent, Norma Nicole Gamarra-Valverde, Rafael Yrivarren-Cespedes","Aims: Differentiation between patients with Takotsubo syndrome and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a challenge. We performed a systematic review to identify and evaluate diagnostic predictive models to distinguish both conditions. Methods and results: We performed an electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus until January 2024. Observational studies that developed and/or validated multivariable diagnostic models to differentiate Takotsubo syndrome from ACS were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). We conducted a narrative synthesis of the performance measures of the diagnostic models evaluated in each study. In addition, a random-effects meta-analysis of the c-statistic with its 95% confidence interval (CI) of the InterTAK model was performed. Of 1015 articles, a total of 11 studies (n = 4552) were included. We identified eight new diagnostic models and eight were external validation of existing models. The most frequent model was InterTAK (n = 4). The reported c-statistic ranged from 0.77 to 0.97 across all models. Calibration plots were reported only for two models. The summary c-statistic was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.73–0.96) for the InterTAK model. The risk of bias was high for all models and the applicability was of low (50%) or unclear (50%) concern. Conclusion: Our review identified multiple diagnostic models to diagnose Takotsubo syndrome. Although most models showed acceptable-to-good discriminative performance, calibration measures were almost unreported and the risk of bias was a concern in most studies.","Diagnosis, Systematic Review, Takotsubo Syndrome","Acute coronary syndrome,Diagnostic model,Systematic review,Takotsubo syndrome",,18790844,10.1002/ejhf.3584,

It may mimic an acute myocardial infarction, accompanied by minimal elevation of cardiac enzymes, usually without evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Most clinicians are unfamiliar with this disorder. Therefore, some TCs are misdiagnosed as acute myocardial infarction. The modified Mayo Clinic criteria usually confirm a diagnosis, although the diagnostic criteria for TC remain controversial. Enhanced awareness by clinicians is important when encountering patients with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually associated with a favorable prognosis, although in rare instances it may be associated with life-threatening complications. Supportive care is especially important in the TC management. Our aim was to describe TC, characterize its clinical features, and extensively review the relevant literature.

However, there is little information about the relationship between functional recovery and tissue characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the recovery process of TTS using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods: Consecutive patients with TTS were prospectively enrolled. We performed serial CMR in the acute phase (<72 h after admission), the subacute phase (7–10 days after admission) and the chronic phase (3 months later). To assess the degree of myocardial edema quantitatively, we evaluated the signal intensity of myocardium on T2-weighted images and calculated the signal intensity ratio compared with the skeletal muscle. Results: Fifteen patients with TTS were enrolled. CMR demonstrated reduced LV ejection fraction in the acute phase, and it recovered almost completely by the subacute phase. On the other hand, severe myocardial edema was still observed in the subacute phase, associated with increased LV mass. The highest signal intensity ratio in the subacute phase was correlated with the maximum voltage of negative T wave on electrocardiogram (r = 0.57, p = 0.03). Conclusions: In patients with TTS, myocardial edema associated with increased LV mass still remained in the subacute phase despite functional recovery of the LV. Electrocardiogram may be useful to assess the degree of myocardial edema in the subacute phase. Our study suggests that myocardial ischemia might have a central role in developing TTS.","Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Myocardial Edema, Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo Syndrome, Transient Apical Wall Thickening","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance,Myocardial edema,Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,Takotsubo syndrome,Transient apical wall thickening",,20770383,10.3390/jcm11040987,

Moreover, we explored EFV in patients with TTC and related this to comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, and cardiac function. Methods: This retrospective study performed CMR scans in 30 consecutive TTC patients and 20 healthy controls. The absolute amount of EFV was quantified in consecutive short-axis cine stacks through the modified Simpson's rule. In addition, the left atrio-ventricular groove (LV) and right ventricle (RV) Epicardial Fat Thickness (EFT) were measured as well. Besides epicardial fat, LV myocardial strain parameters and T2 mapping measurements were obtained. Results: TTC patients and controls were of comparable age, sex, and body mass index. Compared to healthy controls, patients with TTC demonstrated a significantly increased EFV, epicardial fat mass, and EFV indexed for body 7surface area (p = 0.005; p = 0.003; p = 0.008; respectively). In a multiple regression model including age, sex, BMI, atrial fibrillation, and dyslipidemia, TTC remained an independent association with EFV (p = 0.008). Global T2 mapping and Global longitudinal strain in patients with TTC were correlated with EFV (r = 0.63, p = 0.001, and r = 0.44, p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with TTC have increased EFV compared to healthy controls, despite a similar body mass index.

Akashi","Takotsubo syndrome is an acute cardiac syndrome first described in 1990 and characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction affecting more than one coronary artery territory, often in a circumferential apical, mid-ventricular, or basal distribution. Several pathophysiological explanations have been proposed for this syndrome and its intriguing appearance, and awareness is growing that these explanations might not be mutually exclusive. The reversible apical myocardial dysfunction observed might result from more than one pathophysiological phenomenon. The pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome is complex and integrates neuroendocrine physiology, potentially involving the cognitive centres of the brain, and including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Cardiovascular responses are caused by the sudden sympathetic activation and surge in concentrations of circulating catecholamines. The multiple morphological changes seen in the myocardium match those seen after catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity. The acute prognosis and recurrence rate are now known to be worse than initially thought, and much still needs to be learned about the epidemiology and the underlying pathophysiology of this fascinating condition in order to improve diagnostic and treatment pathways.","Pathophysiology, Prognosis, Takotsubo Syndrome",,,17595010,10.1038/nrcardio.2015.39,

Methods: EVOLUTION (Exploring the eVolution in prognOstic capabiLity of mUlti-sequence cardiac magneTIc resOnance in patieNts affected by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) is a multicenter, international registry of TTC patients who will undergo a clinical, TTE, and CMR evaluation. Clinical data including demographics, risk factors, comorbidities, laboratory values, ECG, and results from TTE and CMR analysis will be collected, and each patient will be followed-up for in-hospital and long-term outcomes. Clinical outcome measures during hospitalization will include cardiovascular death, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Clinical long-term outcome measures will include cardiovascular death, pulmonary edema, heart failure, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events defined as a composite endpoint of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, recurrence of TTC, transient ischemic attack, and stroke. We will develop a comprehensive clinical and imaging score that predicts TTC outcomes and test the value of machine learning models, incorporating clinical and imaging parameters to predict prognosis. Conclusions: The main goal of the study is to develop a comprehensive clinical and imaging score, that includes TTE and CMR data, in a large cohort of TTC patients for risk stratification and outcome prediction as a basis for possible changes in patient management.","Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, Machine Learning, Prognosis, Risk Stratification, Takotsubo","Takotsubo,cardiac magnetic resonance,machine learning,prognosis,risk stratification",,15360237,10.1097/RTI.0000000000000709,

The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations.

Feature extraction methods do not have decent performance in these conditions. With small sample sets and high dimensional data, exploring a large search space and learning from insufficient samples becomes extremely hard. As a result, neural networks and clustering algorithms perform poorly on this kind of data. In this paper, a novel hybrid feature selection technique is proposed, which can reduce drastically the number of features with an acceptable loss of prediction accuracy. The proposed approach operates in multiple stages, starting by removing irrelevant features with a low discrimination power, and then eliminating the ones with low variation range. Afterward, among each set of features with high cross-correlation, a single feature that is strongly correlated with the output is kept. Finally, a Genetic Algorithm with a customized cost function is provided to select a small subset of the remainder of features. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we investigated two challenging case studies with sample set sizes of about 100 and the number of features larger than 1000. The experimental results look promising as they showed a percentage decrease of more than 99% in the number of features, with a prediction accuracy of more than 92%.","Data Mining, Evolutionary Methods, Feature Selection, High Dimensional Data, Regression","Data Mining,Evolutionary Methods,Feature Selection,High Dimensional Data,Regression",,1728144X,10.5829/IJE.2020.33.02B.05,

Methods: Herein we review recent cutting-edge and representative examples demonstrating how AI can advance CMR in areas such as exam planning, accelerated image reconstruction, post-processing, quality control, classification and diagnosis. Results: These advances can be applied to speed up and simplify essentially every application including cine, strain, late gadolinium enhancement, parametric mapping, 3D whole heart, flow, perfusion and others. AI is a unique technology based on training models using data. Beyond reviewing the literature, this paper discusses important AI-specific issues in the context of CMR, including (1) properties and characteristics of datasets for training and validation, (2) previously published guidelines for reporting CMR AI research, (3) considerations around clinical deployment, (4) responsibilities of clinicians and the need for multi-disciplinary teams in the development and deployment of AI in CMR, (5) industry considerations, and (6) regulatory perspectives.

However, the reliability and efficacy of these models is difficult to assess, making it difficult for researchers to identify which machine-learning model to apply to their dataset. We assessed whether variance calculations of model metrics (e.g., AUROC, Sensitivity, Specificity) through bootstrap simulation and SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) could increase model transparency and improve model selection. Data from the England National Health Services Heart Disease Prediction Cohort was used. After comparison of model metrics for XGBoost, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Adaptive Boosting, XGBoost was used as the machine-learning model of choice in this study. Boost-strap simulation (N = 10,000) was used to empirically derive the distribution of model metrics and covariate Gain statistics. SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide explanations to machine-learning output and simulation to evaluate the variance of model accuracy metrics. For the XGBoost modeling method, we observed (through 10,000 completed simulations) that the AUROC ranged from 0.771 to 0.947, a difference of 0.176, the balanced accuracy ranged from 0.688 to 0.894, a 0.205 difference, the sensitivity ranged from 0.632 to 0.939, a 0.307 difference, and the specificity ranged from 0.595 to 0.944, a 0.394 difference.

Kowallick, Thomas Stiermaier, Tobias Graf, Torben Lange, Uwe Raaz","Objectives: This study assessed the applicability and prognostic value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) left ventricular deformation analysis in Takotsubo syndrome (TTS). Methods: CMR-feature tracking was performed blinded in a core laboratory to determine circumferential (CS), radial (RS) and longitudinal strain (LS) in 141 TTS patients participating in this cohort study. A subgroup of consecutive TTS patients (n = 20) was compared with age- and sex-matched controls with anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI as well as healthy subjects. Results: Median global CS, RS and LS were -19%, 19% and -12%, respectively. Apical ballooning was associated with significantly lower global CS (p < 0.01) and LS (p < 0.01) compared with midventricular and basal ballooning. Global RS was lowest in patients with basal ballooning (p < 0.01). Segmental analysis resulted in a reliable discrimination of different ballooning patterns using CS and LS. Strain values were significantly lower in TTS compared with non-STEMI patients and healthy subjects, whereas STEMI patients showed similar values. While global CS and RS were not associated with long-term mortality, global LS (cutoff -14.75%) was identified as a potential parameter for long-term risk stratification (mortality rate 17.9% versus 2.5%; p = 0.02). Conclusions: The transient contraction abnormalities in TTS can be quantitatively assessed with CMR-feature tracking. GLS is a potential determinant of outcome in TTS, which, however, requires further validation. Key Points: • Cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking enables accurate assessment of regional and global left ventricular dysfunction in Takotsubo syndrome (TTS). • Global strain in TTS is similar to patients with anterior STEMI and lower compared with non-STEMI and healthy subjects. • Global longitudinal strain is a potential tool for risk prediction in TTS patients.","Left, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Prognosis, Strain, Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, Ventricular Function","Magnetic resonance imaging,Prognosis,Strain,Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,Ventricular function, left",,14321084,10.1007/s00330-018-5475-2,

Some patients are not eligible for a gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR; in this scenario, the diagnosis remains challenging without invasive examination. Our purpose was to derive a machine learning model integrating some non-contrast CMR parameters and demographic factors to identify Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) in subjects with cardiac chest pain. Material and methods: Three groups of patients were retrospectively studied: TTC, acute myocarditis, and healthy controls. Global and regional left ventricular longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain (RS) analysis included were assessed. Reservoir, conduit, and booster bi-atrial functions were evaluated by tissue-tracking. Parametric mapping values were also assessed in all the patients. Five different tree-based ensemble learning algorithms were tested concerning their ability in recognizing TTC in a fully cross-validated framework. Results: The CMR-based machine learning (ML) ensemble model, by using the Extremely Randomized Trees algorithm with Elastic Net feature selection, showed a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 78–100), specificity of 86% (95% CI 80–92) and area under the ROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.99) in diagnosing TTC. Among non-contrast CMR parameters, the Shapley additive explanations analysis revealed that left atrial (LA) strain and strain rate were the top imaging markers in identifying TTC patients. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that using a tree-based ensemble learning algorithm on non-contrast CMR parameters and demographic factors enables the identification of subjects with TTC with good diagnostic accuracy. Translational outlook: Our results suggest that non-contrast CMR features can be implemented in a ML model to accurately identify TTC subjects. This model could be a valuable tool for aiding in the diagnosis of subjects with a contraindication to the contrast media. Furthermore, the left atrial conduit strain and strain rate were imaging markers that had a strong impact on TTC identification.

This review focuses on the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms that could be involved in the occurrence takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Main body: Acute stress and subsequent excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system are major factors in the pathophysiology of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The high levels of catecholamine work in a triggering manner, generate reactive oxygen species, release inflammatory cytokines, and induce endothelial injury. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has increased following COVID-19 infection and vaccination, which suggests that neurohormonal and psychological factors (i.e., fear and anxiety of infection or vaccination) may have an additional role in the pathophysiology. In addition, inflammatory state, cytokine storm, augmented sympathetic activity, and endothelial dysfunction during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection may participate in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Chronic stress is also linked to this complex mechanism by accelerating cripple of endocrinal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, which influences the cortisol effect on releasing catecholamine, which is directly related to the pathogenesis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: The excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system and subsequent high levels of catecholamines could initiate the process. The catecholamines, in turn, generate reactive oxygen species and release inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, CXCL1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), which causes endothelial injury.","Literature Review, Pathophysiology, Stress-induced Cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo Syndrome","Literature review,Pathophysiology,Stress-induced cardiomyopathy,Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,Takotsubo syndrome",,20490801,10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104671,

Tobis, Paolo Angelini","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), a persistently obscure dysfunctional condition of the left ventricle, is uniquely transient but nevertheless dangerous. It features variable ventricular patterns and is predominant in women. For 30 years, pathophysiologic investigations have progressed only slowly and with inadequate focus. It was initially proposed that sudden-onset spastic obliteration of coronary flow induced myocardial ischemia with residual stunning and thus TTC. Later, it was generally accepted without proof that, in the presence of pain or emotional stress, the dominant mechanism for TTC onset was a catecholamine surge that had a direct, toxic myocardial effect. We think that the manifestations of TTC are more dynamic and complex than can be assumed from catecholamine effects alone. In addition, after reviewing the recent medical literature and considering our own clinical observations, especially on spasm, we theorize that atherosclerotic coronary artery disease modulates and physically opposes obstruction during spasm. This phenomenon may explain the midventricular variant of TTC and the lower incidence of TTC in men. We continue to recommend and perform acetylcholine testing to reproduce TTC and to confirm our theory that coronary spasm is its initial pathophysiologic factor. An improved understanding of TTC is especially important because of the condition’s markedly increased incidence during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as an essential tool in its diagnosis and management and is consistently recommended by current guidelines in the diagnostic work-up. However, the prognostic value of CMR in patients with TS remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of CMR in managing patients with TS. Method: PubMed, MEDLINE via Ovid, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies reporting the prognostic role of multiparameteric CMR in patients with TS with a follow-up ≥ 12 months. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as all-cause mortality, cardiac death, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, recurrence of TS, and cerebrovascular events. Results: Five studies with 564 patients were included for reporting correlation of CMR parameters with MACCE. Primary endpoint occurred in 69 (12%) patients. Among the CMR parameters assessed, myocardial strain parameters (including measurements of the left atrium, left and right ventricle), right ventricle involvement, and a CMR-based radiomics model demonstrated correlations with MACCE. Additionally, one study showed the predictive ability of a CMR score. Conclusion: The current systematic review suggests that CMR may offer prognostic insights in TS patients, underscoring its potential clinical utility for integration into clinical practice. However, scarce data are currently available; hence, further research is needed.","Cmr, Outcome, Prognosis, Takotsubo","CMR,Outcome,Prognosis,Takotsubo",,18727727,10.1016/j.ejrad.2024.111576,

In the medical field, there are numerous applications of AI and subsequently, in a relatively short time, significant progress has been made. Cardiology is not immune to this trend, this fact being supported by the exponential increase in the number of publications in which the algorithms play an important role in data analysis, pattern discovery, identification of anomalies, and therapeutic decision making. Furthermore, with technological development, there have appeared new models of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DP) that are capable of exploring various applications of AI in cardiology, including areas such as prevention, cardiovascular imaging, electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, and many others. In this sense, the present article aims to provide a general vision of the current state of AI use in cardiology. Results: We identified and included a subset of 200 papers directly relevant to the current research covering a wide range of applications. Thus, this paper presents AI applications in cardiovascular imaging, arithmology, clinical or emergency cardiology, cardiovascular prevention, and interventional procedures in a summarized manner. Recent studies from the highly scientific literature demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using AI in different branches of cardiology. Conclusions: The integration of AI in cardiology offers promising perspectives for increasing accuracy by decreasing the error rate and increasing efficiency in cardiovascular practice. From predicting the risk of sudden death or the ability to respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or the early detection of valvular diseases, AI algorithms have shown their potential to mitigate human error and provide feasible solutions. At the same time, limits imposed by the small samples studied are highlighted alongside the challenges presented by ethical implementation; these relate to legal implications regarding responsibility and decision making processes, ensuring patient confidentiality and data security. All these constitute future research directions that will allow the integration of AI in the progress of cardiology.","Arithmology, Artificial Intelligence, Cardiology, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Valvular Disease","arithmology,artificial intelligence,cardiology,deep learning,machine learning,valvular disease",,20754418,10.3390/diagnostics14111103,

It has been widely accepted in modern literature that strain analysis can offer incremental information in addition to classic global and segmental functional analysis. Furthermore, CMR-FT facilitates measurement of all cardiac chambers, including the relatively thin-walled atria and the right ventricle, which has been a difficult measurement to obtain with the reference standard technique of myocardial tagging. CMR-FT objectively quantifies cardiovascular impairment and characterizes myocardial function in a novel way through direct assessment of myocardial fiber deformation. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current status of clinical applications of myocardial strain by CMR-FT in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Key Points • CMR-FT is of great value for differential diagnosis and provides incremental value for evaluating the progression and severity of diseases. • CMR-FT guides the early diagnosis of various cardiovascular diseases and provides the possibility for the early detection of myocardial impairment and additional information regarding subclinical cardiac abnormalities. • Direct assessment of myocardial fiber deformation using CMR-FT has the potential to provide prognostic information incremental to common clinical and CMR risk factors.","Cardiovascular Diseases, Diagnosis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Prognosis, Strain","Cardiovascular diseases,Diagnosis,Magnetic resonance imaging,Prognosis,Strain",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-022-08629-2,,10.1007/s00330-022-08629-2/Published,

Its clinical presentation is similar to acute coronary syndrome; therefore, cardiac imaging tools have a crucial role. Coronary angiography is mandatory for exclusion of pathological stenosis. On the other side, transthoracic echocardiography is the first non-invasive imaging modality for an early evaluation of left ventricle systolic and diastolic function. Left ventricle morphologic patterns could be identified according to the localization of wall motion abnormalities. Moreover, an early identification of potential mechanical and electrical complications such as left ventricle outflow tract obstruction, mitral regurgitation, thrombus formation, right ventricular involvement, cardiac rupture, and cardiac rhythm disorders could provide additional information for clinical management and therapy. Because of the dynamic evolution of the syndrome, comprehensive serial echocardiographic examinations should be systematically performed.

This systematic review evaluated the T1 and T2 parametric mapping to delineate the current diagnostic and prognostic CMR imaging outcomes in TTS. Methods: A comprehensive literature search until October 2023 was performed on ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library by two independent reviewers adhering to the PRISMA framework. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies. Results: Out of 198 results, 8 studies were included in this qualitative synthesis, accounting for a total population of 399 subjects (TTS = 201, controls = 175, acute myocarditis = 14, and acute regional myocardial oedema without infarction = 9). Approximately 50.4 % were TTS patients aged between 61 and 73 years, whereof, females (n = 181, 90.0 %) and apical variants (n = 180, 89.6 %) were significantly higher, and emotional stressor (n = 42; 20.9 %) was more prevalent than physical (n = 27; 13.4 %). The NOS identified 62.5 % of studies as moderate and 37.5 % as high quality. Parametric tissue mapping revealed significantly prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times at 1.5T and 3T respectively in TTS (1053–1164 msec, 1292–1438 msec; and 56–67 msec, 60–90 msec) with higher extracellular volume (ECV) fraction (29–36 %), compared to healthy subjects (944–1211 msec, 1189–1251 msec; and 46–54 msec, 32–68 msec; 23–29 %) and myocarditis (1058 msec, 60 msec). Other significant myocardial abnormalities included increased left ventricular (LV) end-systolic and diastolic volume and reduced global longitudinal strain. Overall, myocardial oedema, altered LV mass and strain, and worse LV systolic function, with higher native T1, T2, and ECV values were consistent. Conclusions: Future research with substantially larger clinical trials is vital to explore the CMR imaging findings in diverse TTS patient cohorts and correlate the T1 and T2 mapping outcomes with demographic/clinical covariates.

However recent investigations have proven otherwise and have shown SCM patients might have comparable long-term morbidity and mortality to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Many emotional, or physical stressors can trigger SCM, and have been able to describe an interplay of neurohormonal and inflammatory mechanisms as the pathophysiology of this disease. Additionally, given the significantly higher prevalence of SCM in post-menopausal women, estrogen levels have been thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, there is an elusive disparity in prognosis depending upon different triggers. Currently, many questions remain unanswered regarding the long-term management of these patients to reduce morbidity, mortality, and improve quality of life, such as the need for long-term anticoagulation.

In a patient who presents with cardiac symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, and/or biomarker elevation indicating myocardial stress (i.e. troponin elevation), this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Cardiac imaging is critical for a timely diagnosis of this condition and has management implications. This syndrome can occur with or without underlying coronary artery disease, and while there are various characteristic myocardial patterns described on imaging, the most common one is left ventricular dysfunction due to apical stunning with basal hyperkinesis. In the acute phase, Takotsubo syndrome can lead to life-threatening sequelae, including cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, thromboembolism, and arrhythmias. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are implicated, including an acute increase in left ventricular afterload in the setting of sympathetic activation with a catecholamine storm, multi-vessel coronary vasospasm, coronary endothelial microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation.

Lishmanov","The purpose of the review is the analysis of clinical and experimental data on the etiology and pathogenesis of takotsubo syndrome (TS). TS is characterized by contractile dysfunction, which usually affects the apical region of the heart, lack of coronary artery obstruction, moderate increase in myocardial necrosis markers, prolonged QTc interval (in 50% of patients), sometimes elevation of ST segment (in 19% of patients), increase N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide level, microvascular dysfunction, sometimes spasm of the epicardial coronary arteries (in 10% of patients), myocardial edema, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (in 11% of patients). Stress cardiomyopathy is a rare disease, it is observed in 0.6 - 2.5% of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The occurrence of takotsubo syndrome is 9 times higher in women, who are aged 60-70 years old , than in men. The hospital mortality among patients with TS corresponds to 3.5% - 12%. In many patients with TS, but not in all, physical or emotional stress precedes the disease. Many patients with TS, but not all, have neurological or mental illnesses. The level of catecholamines is increased in patients with TS, therefore, the occurrence of TS is associated with the excessive activation of the adrenergic system. The negative inotropic effect of catecholamines is associated with the activation of β2 adrenergic receptors. An important role of the adrenergic system in the pathogenesis of TS is confirmed by studies which were performed using 125I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (125I -MIBG). TS causes edema and inflammation of the myocardium. The inflammatory response in TS is systemic. TS causes impaired coronary microcirculation and reduces coronary reserve. There is reason to believe that an increase in blood viscosity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of microcirculatory dysfunction in patients with TS. Epicardial coronary artery spasm is not obligatory for the occurrence of TS. Cortisol, endothelin-1 and microRNAs are challengers for the role of TS triggers. A decrease in estrogen levels is a factor contributing to the onset of TS. The central nervous system appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of TS.","Pathophysiology, Stress Cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo Syndrome",,,1573403X,10.2174/1573403x16666200129114330,

Methods: We retrospectively selected 50 patients with TTS clinical-radiological diagnosis who underwent CMR within 30 days since symptoms onset: 19 studied during the early subacute phase (sTTS, ≤ 7 days) and 31 during the convalescence (cTTS, 8–30 days). We measured the following: LV global longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain (lvGLS, lvGCS, lvGRS) and strain rate (SR) and LA reservoir (laS_r), conduit (laS_cd), and booster pump strain (laS_bp) and strain rate (laSR_r, laSR_cd, laSR_bp). Patients were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched controls. Results: All patients were women (mean age 63 years). TTS patients showed altered LV- and LA-strain features, compared to controls. sTTS was associated with increased laS_bp (12.7% versus 9.8%) and reduced lvEF (47.4% versus 54.8%), lvGLS (-12.2% versus 14.6%), and laS_cd (7.0% versus 9.5%) compared to cTTS (p ≤ 0.029). The interval between symptoms onset and CMR was correlated with laS_bp (r = -0.49) and lvGLS (r = 0.47) (p = 0.001 for both). At receiver operating characteristics analysis, laS_bp was the best discriminator between sTTS and cTTS (area under the curve [AUC] 0.815), followed by lvGLS (AUC 0.670). Conclusions: LA dysfunction persists during the subacute and convalescence of TTS. laS_bp increases in subacute phase with progressive decrease during convalescence, representing a compensatory mechanism of LV dysfunction and thus a useful index of functional recovery. Relevance statement: Atrial strain has the potential to enhance the delineation of cardiac injury and functional impairment in TTS patients, assisting in the identification of individuals at higher risk and facilitating the implementation of more targeted and personalized medical therapies. Key points: • In TTS, after ventricular recovery, atrial dysfunction persists assessable with CMR feature tracking. • Quantitative assessment of atrial strain discriminates atrial functions: reservoir, conduit, and booster pump. • Atrial booster pump changes after acute TTS, regardless of ventricular function. • Atrial strain may serve as a temporal marker in TTS.

57,T,Takotsubo syndrome: unravelling the enigma of the broken heart syndrome?—a narrative review,Not started,,2023,Review,,,,"Fernando Alfonso, Jorge Salamanca","Background and Objective: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a condition characterized by transient ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities, without causative coronary artery disease, typically triggered by emotional or physical stress. TTS is more common in post-menopausal women, closely resembling acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in its clinical presentation, with multiple proposed underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and no evidence-based treatments. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest research, encompassing the pathophysiology, diagnostic findings, prognosis, and treatment options for TTS patients. Methods: Relevant literature from 1990 to June 2023 on TTS epidemiology, physiopathology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prognosis was retrieved through PubMed research. Only English publications were included. Key Content and Findings: TTS is an increasingly recognized cardiovascular disorder, a significant release of catecholamines is thought to be a key contributing element, yet its exact mechanism remains unclear. Notably, TTS poses significant short and long-term risks akin to ACS. Initial treatment should focus on ruling out ACS and providing standard care for subsequent left ventricular dysfunction and complications. Research hints at a potential role for Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers in improving long-term prognosis in TTS patients. Conclusions: Significant knowledge gaps still exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment options, and areas for improvement in diagnosing and prognosticating this intriguing condition. Further research is therefore needed.","Acute Coronary Syndrome (acs), Acute Heart Failure, Broken Heart Syndrome, Narrative Review, Takotsubo Syndrome (tts)","Takotsubo syndrome (TTS),acute coronary syndrome (ACS),acute heart failure,broken heart syndrome,narrative review",,22233660,10.21037/cdt-23-283,

Methods: This retrospective, IRB-approved study included 32 patients with known HCM. Thirty patients with normal CMR served as controls. Regions-of-interest for TA encompassing the left ventricle were drawn on short-axis non-contrast T1-weighted images using a freely available software package. Step-wise dimension reduction and texture feature selection was performed for selecting features enabling the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in HCM patients on non-contrast T1-weighted CMR images. Results: Comparing HCM patients and controls, four texture features were identified showing significant differences between groups (Grey-level Non-uniformity [GLevNonU]: 74 ± 17 vs. 38 ± 9, p <.001; Energy of wavelet coefficients in low-frequency sub-bands [WavEnLL]: 58 ± 5 vs. 48 ± 10, p <.001; Fraction: 0.70 ± 0.07 vs. 0.78 ± 0.05, p <.001; Sum Average: 16.6 ± 0.4 vs. 17.0 ± 0.5, p =.007). A model containing the single parameter GLevNonU proved to be the best for differentiating between HCM patients and controls with a sensitivity/specificity of 91%/93%. A cut-off of GLevNonU ≥46 allowed for distinguishing HCM patients from controls with a sensitivity/specificity of 94%/90%. Even in patients without late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), the defined cut-off led to a differentiation of LGE- patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Conclusions: TA on non-contrast T1-weighted images allows for the detection of myocardial tissue alterations in the setting of HCM with excellent accuracy, delivering potential novel parameters for a non-contrast assessment of myocardial texture alterations.","Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, Hcm, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Machine Learning, Non-contrast Imaging Techniques, Texture Analysis","Cardiac magnetic resonance,HCM,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Machine learning,Non-contrast imaging techniques,Texture analysis",,18727727,10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.03.013,
59,T,The Brier score does not evaluate the clinical utility of diagnostic tests or prediction models,Not started,,2017,,,,,"Andrew J. Vickers, Daniel D. Sjoberg, Melissa Assel","A variety of statistics have been proposed as tools to help investigators assess the value of diagnostic tests or prediction models. The Brier score has been recommended on the grounds that it is a proper scoring rule that is affected by both discrimination and calibration. However, the Brier score is prevalence dependent in such a way that the rank ordering of tests or models may inappropriately vary by prevalence. We explored four common clinical scenarios: comparison of a highly accurate binary test with a continuous prediction model of moderate predictiveness; comparison of two binary tests where the importance of sensitivity versus specificity is inversely associated with prevalence; comparison of models and tests to default strategies of assuming that all or no patients are positive; and comparison of two models with miscalibration in opposite directions. In each case, we found that the Brier score gave an inappropriate rank ordering of the tests and models. Conversely, net benefit, a decision-analytic measure, gave results that always favored the preferable&nbsp;test or model. Brier score does not evaluate clinical value of diagnostic tests or prediction models. We advocate, as an alternative, the use of decision-analytic measures such as net benefit.

60,T,The emerging role of atrial strain assessed by cardiac MRI in different cardiovascular settings: an up-to-date review,Not started,,2022,Review,,,,"Gianluca Pontone, Jasjit S Suri, Luca Saba, Pierpaolo Bassareo, Riccardo Cau","The left atrium (LA) has a crucial function in maintaining left ventricular filling, which is responsible for about one-third of all cardiac filling. A growing body of evidence shows that LA is involved in several cardiovascular diseases from a clinical and prognostic standpoint. LA enlargement has been recognized as a predictor of the outcomes of many diseases. However, LA enlargement itself does not explain the whole LA's function during the cardiac cycle. For this reason, the recently proposed assessment of atrial strain at advanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) enables the usual limitations of the sole LA volumetric measurement to be overcome. Moreover, the left atrial strain impairment might allow several cardiovascular diseases to be detected at an earlier stage. While traditional CMR has a central role in assessing LA volume and, through cine sequences, a marginal role in evaluating LA function, feature tracking at advanced CMR (CMR-FT) has been increasingly confirmed as a feasible and reproducible technique for assessing LA function through strain. In comparison to atrial function evaluations via speckle tracking echocardiography, CMR-FT has a higher spatial resolution, larger field of view, and better reproducibility. In this literature review on atrial strain analysis, we describe the strengths, limitations, recent applications, and promising developments of studying atrial function using CMR-FT in clinical practice. Key Points • The left atrium has a crucial function in maintaining left ventricular filling; left atrial size has been recognized as a predictor of the outcomes of many diseases. • Left atrial strain has been confirmed as a marker of atrial functional status and demonstrated to be a sensitive tool in the subclinical phase of a disease. • A comprehensive evaluation of the three phases of atrial function by CMR-FT demonstrates an impairment before the onset of atrial enlargement, thus helping clinicians in their decision-making and improving patient outcomes.","Advanced Imaging, Atrial Strain, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, Echocardiography, Feature Tracking","Advanced imaging,Atrial strain,Cardiac magnetic resonance,Echocardiography,Feature tracking",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-022-08598-6,,10.1007/s00330-022-08598-6/Published,

Because TTC often mimics acute myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary disease, the condition is often underdiagnosed in the population. Our aim was to discuss the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in diagnosing TTC. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception until April 8, 2023, for studies on the utility of AI- or ML-based algorithms in diagnosing TTC compared with other cardiovascular diseases or healthy controls. We summarized major findings in a narrative fashion and tabulated relevant numerical parameters. Results: Five studies with a total of 920 patients were included. Four hundred and forty-seven were diagnosed with TTC via International Classification of Diseases codes or the Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria, while there were 473 patients in the comparator group (29 of healthy controls, 429 of myocardial infarction, and 14 of acute myocarditis). Hypertension and smoking were the most common comorbidities in both cohorts, but there were no statistical differences between TTC and comparators. Two studies utilized deep-learning algorithms on transthoracic echocardiographic images, while the rest incorporated supervised ML on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 12-lead electrocardiographs, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. All studies found that AI-based algorithms can increase the diagnostic rate of TTC when compared to healthy controls or myocardial infarction patients. In three of these studies, AI-based algorithms had higher sensitivity and specificity compared to human readers. Conclusion: AI and ML algorithms can improve the diagnostic capacity of TTC and additionally reduce erroneous human error in differentiating from MI and healthy individuals.","Artificial Intelligence, Diagnostics, Precision Medicine, Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy","Artificial intelligence,diagnostics,precision medicine,takotsubo cardiomyopathy",,24686484,10.4103/hm.HM-D-23-00061,

In a field where accountability is indispensable, the prime reason why medical practitioners are still reluctant to utilize AI models, is the reliability of these models. However, explainable AI (XAI) was a game changing discovery where the so-called back boxes can be interpreted using Explainability algorithms. The proposed conceptual model reviews the existing recent researches for AI in heartcare that have found success in the past few years. The various techniques explored range from clinical history analysis, medical imaging to the nonlinear dynamic theory of chaos to metabolomics with specific focus on machine learning, deep learning and Explainability. The model also comprehensively surveys the different modalities of datasets used in heart disease prediction focusing on how results differ based on the different datasets along with the publicly available datasets for experimentation. The review will be an eye opener for medical researchers to quickly identify the current progress and to identify the most reliable data and AI algorithm that is appropriate for a particular technology for heartcare along with the Explainability algorithm suitable for the specific task.","Data Analytics, Electrocardiogram, Electronic Health Record, Explainability, Metabolomics, Non-linear Dynamics","Data analytics,Electrocardiogram,Electronic health record,Explainability,Metabolomics,Non-linear dynamics",,22131248,10.1016/j.jksuci.2024.102096,

Kondratiuk, Olga I. Tereshkina, Sofiya Y. Belogubova, Susanna S. Sologova","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS) has become a recognised clinical entity since the Japanese scientist Sato first described it in 1990. Despite an increasing number of confirmed cases, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, and decision-making differs in the diagnosis and treatment. In addition, it is not evident whether a significant increase in TTS is due to better understanding among practitioners and widespread access to coronary angiography, or if it is a reflection of an actual increase in incidence. We analysed a series of international research studies from 1990 to 2021. Beyond epidemiology and clinical presentation, we evaluated and summarised fundamental knowledge about various predisposing factors, with particular attention to the iatrogenic impact of certain drugs, namely antidepressants, chemotherapy, and antiarrhythmics. Furthermore, we highlighted the main pathophysiological theories to date. In addition, based on published studies and clinical cases, we investigated the role of numerous diagnostic approaches in the differential diagnosis of TTS and identified predictors of TTS complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular fibrillation, and left ventricular thrombi. Accordingly, we sought to propose a diagnostic algorithm and further treatment management of TTS under the presence of possible complications to help practitioners make more informed decisions, as the initial presentation continues to pose a challenge due to its close similarity to acute coronary syndrome with ST-elevation. In conclusion, this article examines Takotsubo cardiomyopathy from different perspectives and, along with future systematic reviews and meta-analyses, can be of particular interest to practising cardiologists and researchers in developing clinical guidelines.","Cardiomyopathy, Complication, Diagnostics, Risk Factors, Takotsubo, Treatment","Cardiomyopathy,Complication,Diagnostics,Risk factors,Takotsubo,Treatment",,23529067,10.1016/j.ijcha.2022.100990,
